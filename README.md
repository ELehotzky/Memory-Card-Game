**Hello and welcome to my Memory Card Game!**

# Start Game

-To begin, open the index.html file in your browser.

# Game Rules

-The object of the game is to match all game cards with their pair. 
-Flip a card by clicking on it. Select another card and if the images match, they will turn green and stay open. If not, you have one second to view both cards so take notice and remember what symbols were in which spot!
-Continue flipping and matching cards until the entire board is unlocked.
-Once you've completed the board, you should see a banner with your time and rating. The fewer flips you have to make, the better your rating! 
-To restart or try again, touch the reset button next to the timer. Try to beat your score!
